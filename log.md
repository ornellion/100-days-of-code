# 100 Days Of Code - Log
<!--
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: January 1, 2024 
*Normally I would start on Day One but in the spirit of Computer Science, let's go with Day 0*

**Today's Progress**: 

I am currently completing Codecademy's [Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-python-3-) course. I am 93% completed. 
Today I spent 1hr30 working on Python Code Challenges: Strings (Advanced).  

I created functions that: 
- Checked if a user's name is located within a greeting
- Extracted every other letter from a string and returned the resulting string
- Reversed the letters of a given string
- Made a "Spoonerism" (switched the first letters of two words)
- Added an exclamation mark to a string until it reached the desired length

**Thoughts**:

Compared to the first time I tackled Python Challenges, I feel like I'm identifying what I do and don't know a lot faster and knowing what to search for when my work throws an error. 

My current focus is getting to the solution but I'm also starting to pay attention to *how* I get to the solution. I'm starting to ask myself ow can I get to a point where writing one line and list comprehension are the norm rather than an "oh I see!" moment when I check the Codecademy solution. 

This is my first day using GitHub so I still need to figure out how to push code to GitHub to be able to link.

### Day 1: January 2, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

Today I spent 1hr30 working on Python Code Challenges: Dictionaries. 

I created functions that:
- Sum up all of the values from the key-value pairs in the dictionary
- Retrieve the sum of the values of all even keys
- Adds 10 to every value and returns the modified dictionary
- Returns a list of all the values in a dictionary that are also keys
- Returns the key associated with the largest value in a dictionary

**Thoughts**:

I see the progress in my approach and my knowledge is slowly but surely coming together. I see that I have a similar issue with dictionaries as I do with indexes - I struggle with finding the correct syntax to call the information I want. I also need to get ahead of my bad habit of sticking unnecessary if statements all over the shop.

### Day 2: January 3, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

Today I spent 1hr 30 on Pythong Code Challenges: Dictionaries (Advanced) and Classes 

I created functions that: 
- Creates a new dictionary where the key is a word and the value is the length of the word
- Counts the frequency of each string within a list of elements
- Counts how many unique values are within a dictionary
- Calculates the number of people have the same first letter in their last name

For the Classes challenge I created a new class, initialised the instance variables and created an object from the class. 

**Thoughts**:
I see the benefit of having both simpler and more advanced challenges. Sometimes the simpler challenges are the hardest as I overthink, but then by the time I get to the more advanced challenges I have the foundations down. I'm 100& getting better at finding the solutions to my questions on StackOverFlow.
