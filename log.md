# 100 Days Of Code - Log
<!--
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: January 1, 2024 
*Normally I would start on Day One but in the spirit of Computer Science, let's go with Day 0*

**Today's Progress**: 
I am currently completing Codecademy's [Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-python-3-) course. I am 93% completed. 
Today I spent 1hr30 working on Python Code Challenges: Strings (Advanced).  

I created functions that: 
- Checked if a user's name is located within a greeting
- Extracted every other letter from a string and returned the resulting string
- Reversed the letters of a given string
- Made a "Spoonerism" (switched the first letters of two words)
- Added an exclamation mark to a string until it reached the desired length

**Thoughts**
Compared to the first time I tackled Python Challenges, I feel like I'm identifying what I do and don't know a lot faster and knowing what to search for when my work throws an error. 

My current focus is getting to the solution but I'm also starting to pay attention to *how* I get to the solution. I'm starting to ask myself ow can I get to a point where writing one line and list comprehension are the norm rather than an "oh I see!" moment when I check the Codecademy solution. 

This is my first day using GitHub so I still need to figure out how to push code to GitHub to be able to link.
